Come kick-off on Saturday evening, France and Scotland will know exactly what is required of them. For the hosts, a record-levelling seventh Six Nations title since Italy joined the party in 2000, could be sealed if Ireland and England slip up. Victory by any margin will also tie up the trophy.



Fabien Galthie's men sit atop the standings heading into the last round after a commanding victory over reigning champions Ireland in Dublin. Now, they have the opportunity to seal the championship and set a new record for the most points scored in a single Six Nations campaign, having already steamrolled past Wales, Italy, and Ireland.

Meanwhile, Scotland's hopes of clinching the title are slim, with their erratic form throughout the tournament proving costly. They need Ireland and England to both suffer defeats while also running in four tries and pulling off a staggering 52-point triumph over France to have any chance of claiming the championship. Nevertheless, they will be looking to spoil France's party and end their campaign on a high.

For the Scots—if Ireland and England both lose—they'll simply need to win with a 103-point swing over their opponents to lift the cup. More realistically, the visitors could open the door for the Irish or English to claim the championship with success in Paris.

Bolstering their ranks, France welcome back veteran centre Gaël Fickou, in for the injured Pierre-Louis Barassi, who has missed the rest of the championship with a broken thumb. Fickou will draw level with Philippe Sella's record for Six Nations appearances on 50.

Behind the scrum, Maxime Lucu replaces Antoine Dupont who is ruled out for the foreseeable due to a torn ACL suffered against Ireland.

Typically that loss would represent a near-fatal blow for Les Bleus, with Dupont instrumental to everything France do well. But in Dublin, Lucu orchestrated his troops beautifully, suggesting he's hitting his straps just when his country needs him.

Elsewhere, head coach Fabien Galthie has stuck with the same pack and 7:1 split of forwards to backs on the bench, with scrum-half Nolann Le Garrec the solitary back replacement.

France took control of the title race last weekend with a sensational display in Dublin, thrashing Ireland to end their Grand Slam hopes. That came even with Antoine Dupont limping off in the first-half with a serious knee injury, one that means France will once again be without their captain and the world’s best player tonight.

A shoo-in for player of the tournament, Louis Bielle-Biarrey continues on the left wing. The 21-year-old is virtually untouchable with seven tries and four try assists so far.

After their spectacular win over Ireland in Dublin a week ago, the title is France’s to lose. Comfortably ahead in the table and with an awe-inspiring points difference, a win effectively guarantees them the championship. Scotland aren’t just in town to make up the numbers, however, and after an impressive first-half performance in last Saturday’s win over Wales, they’ll be confident they can cause an upset.

For Scotland, a championship that promised so much has once again passed them by, yet Gregor Townsend's charges can still leave their mark on the tournament with a strong performance in Paris. Victory, however unlikely, could even pave the way for an Ireland or England title.

Bidding to repeat their 2021 feat of an away win in the Stade de France, Townsend has made just two changes to the starting XV. Gregor Brown replaces Jonny Gray in the second row and number eight Matt Fagerson swaps with the injured Jack Dempsey.

Last weekend's stunning win over Grand Slam-chasing Ireland in Dublin means the championship is France's to lose coming into this final match of the tournament.

Looking to wreck the party in Paris is a Scotland team that will feel confident of pulling off a shock after its superb first-half performance in last Saturday's win over Wales.

Back row forwards Marshall Sykes and Ben Muncaster are set to earn their tournament debuts off the bench.dfghgfdsa
